# MyCpp

Welcome to **MyCpp** – a repository dedicated to my learning journey through C++. This collection features projects and learning files that are designed to be buildable and runnable without any extra resources.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Repository for practicing and learning C++.
- **Design:** Provides projects with minimal external dependencies.
- **Structure:**
  - _Section 1:_ Projects built with Visual Studio without CMake.
  - _Section 2+:_ Projects built with CMake (primarily in Clion).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE:
   - Use **Visual Studio** for Section 1 projects.
   - Use **Clion** or any CMake-compatible IDE for later sections.
3. Follow the build instructions provided in each project’s subdirectory.
